# Bin-Packing Problem Project

This project addresses the bin-packing problem using four different algorithms. The bin-packing problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where objects of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins of fixed capacity in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. First-Fit Decreasing Algorithm
2. Tabu Search Algorithm
3. Genetic Algorithm
4. Simulated Annealing Algorithm

## Conference Paper

The conference paper for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/josephchay/1d-bin-packing-java-4-algos/blob/main/conference-paper.pdf).

The conference paper demonstrates our study on the algorithms implemented to solve the problem with the 
analysis on the results obtained.
